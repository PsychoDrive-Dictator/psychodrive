PsychoDrive is a fighting game engine, currently able to express some of the scripts from SF6 for simulation and labbing purposes. It supports keyboard input, controller input, and recorded input along with a detailed input timeline editor. You can't currently use it if you don't own SF6, consider it like a SF6 mod for the time being.
